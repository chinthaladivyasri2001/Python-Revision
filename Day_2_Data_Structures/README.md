## Key Points for README: Python File Handling and Data Structures

Common Data Structures:

Lists: Ordered, mutable sequences that can contain mixed data types.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs for fast lookups.
Tuples: Immutable sequences for fixed data.
Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements for fast membership tests.
Comprehensions:

List Comprehensions: A concise way to create lists with conditions.
Dictionary Comprehensions: A compact way to create dictionaries.
Advantages of Python File Handling:

Versatile, user-friendly, cross-platform support.
Disadvantages:

Susceptible to errors with incorrect paths or permissions.
Potential security risks and performance issues with large files.

File Handling Basics:

Open, read, write, and close files using Python's built-in open() function.
Supports different file modes: r (read), w (write), a (append), and more.
Use context managers (with statement) to automatically handle file closure.
File Types:

Text and binary files are handled differently.
Supports working with various file formats: plain text, CSV, JSON.
CSV Handling:

Read and write CSV files using Python’s csv module.
CSV is used for simple tabular data exchange.
JSON Handling:

Read and write JSON files with Python’s json module.
JSON is a lightweight data format useful for structured data exchange.
